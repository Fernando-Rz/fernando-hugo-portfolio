## Hi, I'm Fernando Rodriguez!
Iâ€™m a software engineer from NC with a passion for creativity and problem-solving. I am currently on the lookout for my next adventure!
I enjoy both frontend and backend development but I also like working with data. I would love to connect on Linkedin and grow my network, so please feel free to reach out! 

In the future I plan on adding a blog onto this site to share projects, and other code related things!

When I am not coding some of my favorite hobbies include fitness, soccer, cooking, hiking, and music.
Something I have always been interested in is creating my own website dedicated to music! More to come later! 

:)
