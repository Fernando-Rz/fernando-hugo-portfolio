      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Fernando Rodriguez! I’m a software engineer from NC with a passion for creativity and problem-solving. I am currently on the lookout for my next adventure! I enjoy both frontend and backend development but I also like working with data. I would love to connect on Linkedin and grow my network, so please feel free to reach out!&#xA;In the future I plan on adding a blog onto this site to share projects, and other code related things!</description>
